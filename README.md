# Elite-Dangerous-HUD-Script
Learning Python and made a script that will generate an XML file for your HUD colors on Elite Dangerous. All you have to do is enter the location of your xml file in the script. 
Even when the game gets an update your HUD will stay as the color you have chosen.

On Windows the xml file to target is found at:
'C:\Users\*Your Name*\AppData\Local\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous\Options\Graphics' by default.

You can use Kimmo Kulovesi's website to get custom matrix values.

R:  1, 0, 0.29\
G:  0, 1, 0\
B: 0, 0, 0.51

The default values:
R:  1, 0, 0
G:  0, 1, 0
B:  0, 0, 1
